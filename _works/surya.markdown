Surya represents a selection of brands in the wellness, bio-construction and energy saving sector in Switzerland. Their new website's layout was designed by [Lorenzo Butti](http://lorenzobutti.com). I then used this layout to build the site using [Kirby CMS](http://getkirby.com) and make it a responsive, mobile friendly web site.
