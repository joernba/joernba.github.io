“LAN (Local Architecture Network) was created by Benoît Jallon and Umberto Napolitano in 2002, with the idea of exploring architecture as an area of activity at the intersection of several disciplines.”

I was asked to build their new website by Nicola Aguzzi from [Undo-Redo](http://www.undo-redo.com) who did the design and concept work. We worked together to get from static layouts to a responsive experience that makes the website work on devices with different screen resolutions from retina desktop to small phone screens.

To achieve this I used the excellent [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com), hosting on [Fortrabbit](https://www.fortrabbit.com) and Amazon S3 for asset storage.
