Leaving a promising career in photography behind to go to a foreign country and to learn a new language was one of my best decisions. I am convinced that pushing personal limits and setting high bars brings out the best in everyone. Learning new skills, languages and being curious is the most important thing to move ourselves forward. I’m looking for something new to learn every day.

I’m currently working as a freelance web designer and developer collaborating with many smart people. Here’s a short list of some of them: [Alessandro Ratti](http://geekbreakfast.it), [Lorenzo Butti](http://lorenzobutti.com), [Diane Le Cam](http://dianelecam.com), Nicola Aguzzi of [Undo Redo, Paris](http://www.undo-redo.com).

Here you can find what I do [specifically](/what-i-do). And here are some assorted [projects I worked on](/projects).

I’m available for new projects from {{ site.available_from }}. [Get in touch](mailto:me@joern.im)!
